# iTunes XML Parser

Simple script interface to transform your iTunes XML file into an HTML file.

## Usage

- `python itunes_parser.py`
- `python itunes_parser.py <xml_file> <html_output>`

## Why

I have a bad memory and never remember what great music I had in my library
'back in the day.'

I abandoned iTunes years ago for [Spotify](http://spotify.com), but every now
and then I want to check for some of my old music on
[Spotify](http://spotify.com).

Thought it might be a fun hour long hack.
